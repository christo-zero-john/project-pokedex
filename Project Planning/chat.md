## User's Project Description

I want to create a device like pokedex in the pokemon anime. It works like this:

- First I have a website with data of all pokemons.
- I will supply rfid cards with a unique identifier in the market.
- I also have a mobile app which works like the app of smartwatches.
- The pokedex can be connected with smartphones using bluetooth.
- When this rfid is readed by my pokedex, it then send the unique id that is stored in the rfid to my mobile app. The mobile app then display the data of that pokemon on the app.
- Also the user can create account in my website via the mobile app.
- Once the unique identifier is recieved by the mobile app, it registers that unique id with that user account.
- Every pokemon in the database has numerous unique identifiers. These identifiers are one time use only. Once the user scans that pokemon using the pokedex, the app then marks that identifier as used.
- After registering the unique identifier with the user account, I will then write the pokemon-id of the pokemon which is related to that unique identifier in the rfid to the pokedex via the mobile app.
- The pokedex will then store the pokemon-id related to that unique identifier.
- This counts as the user catching a pokemon.
- Every unique identifier has a random power value assosciated with it. If the user reads the unique identifier of same pokemon from other cards, the power value of his/her pokemon is added.
- If the power value of a pokemon reaches 25, the star of the pokemon is incremented by 1. If the pokemon becomes 5 star, it can be evolved.
- For every generation of pokemon, the stars needed to be evolved is 4 + generation of pokemon.
- If the pokemon is basic pokemon, then its generation is 1.
- If the pokemon has evolved n times, its generation will be n+1.

- If the rfid card with that same unique identifier is read by the some other pokedex, the user will get an eror that tells him, the card is already registered with someone elses account.

## The Pokedex and RFID

- The pokedex is a device that can be connected to mobile device via bluetooth.
- It has a storage size of 4GB.
- It stores user-id, client-id (which is some identifier used to identify the mobile device), an array of pokemon-id's, (which is the ID of pokemon's that the user owns), and the unique identifier of the rfid card from which the pokemon is collected or catched by the user.
- It also stores the data of the pokemon that the user has in their collection.
- A single pokedex could store a maximum of 200 pokemon's.
- It also has an RGB light, some buttons, speaker etc...
- It exactly looks and works like the pokedex in pokemon anime except that, it only stores data of the pokemon that the user owns.
- When connected to the smartphone via bluetooth, it could identify any pokemon that is stored in any RFID.
- When the user queries over the pokemon via the pokedex, the pokedex will speak out name, description etc... of the pokemon through the speaker. Ath the same time, the rgb light plays some interesting light patterns just like the pokedex in pokemon anime.
- Querying pokemon happens when:
  - User queries through the pokemon they owns.
  - When User reads the pokemon using an rfid, (the data is fetched from the smartphone and outputs through the pokedex).

## Discussion on MCU and Hardware Design

### MCU Selection

Given the requirements, you'll need an MCU that supports:

1. **Bluetooth Connectivity**: To connect with smartphones.
2. **RFID Reading**: To read RFID cards.
3. **Storage Management**: To handle up to 4GB of storage.
4. **Peripheral Control**: For RGB lights, buttons, and speakers.
5. **Power Efficiency**: Since it's a portable device.

**Recommended MCU**:

- **ESP32**: This is a versatile and powerful MCU that supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (if needed for future expansion), and has sufficient GPIO pins for controlling peripherals. It also has a low-power mode, which is beneficial for battery-operated devices.

### Hardware Design

1. **RFID Reader**:

   - Use an RFID module compatible with the ESP32, such as the RC522 or PN532. These modules can interface with the ESP32 via SPI or I2C.

2. **Storage**:

   - Use an external storage solution like an SD card module. The ESP32 can interface with SD cards using SPI, which is suitable for storing large amounts of data.

3. **Bluetooth Module**:

   - The ESP32 has built-in Bluetooth, so no additional module is needed. Ensure your firmware is set up to handle Bluetooth communication with the mobile app.

4. **RGB Lights**:

   - Use an RGB LED strip or individual RGB LEDs. Control them using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) through the ESP32's GPIO pins.

5. **Buttons**:

   - Connect buttons to the GPIO pins of the ESP32. Use pull-up or pull-down resistors to ensure stable input readings.

6. **Speaker**:

   - Use a small speaker or buzzer. The ESP32 can generate sound using PWM or a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) if higher quality audio is needed.

7. **Power Supply**:
   - Consider using a rechargeable battery with a charging circuit. The ESP32 can be powered by a LiPo battery, and you can use a TP4056 module for charging.

### Additional Considerations

- **Enclosure**: Design a durable and ergonomic enclosure that resembles the Pokedex from the anime. Consider 3D printing for custom designs.
- **User Interface**: Plan the layout of buttons and the display (if any) for ease of use.
- **Firmware Development**: Develop firmware to handle Bluetooth communication, RFID reading, and peripheral control. Use the ESP-IDF or Arduino framework for development.

## MCU Options for Smartwatches

1. **Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear Series**:

   - These are specifically designed for wearables and include models like the Snapdragon Wear 2100, 3100, and 4100. They offer integrated Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS, along with efficient power management.

2. **Apple S Series**:

   - Used in Apple Watches, these are custom-designed SoCs by Apple, such as the S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6. They integrate multiple functions including processing, graphics, and wireless communication.

3. **Samsung Exynos Series**:

   - Samsung uses its Exynos processors in some of its smartwatches, like the Exynos 9110, which provides efficient performance and connectivity options.

4. **MediaTek MT2601**:

   - This is a low-power SoC designed for Android Wear devices, offering dual-core processing and integrated connectivity.

5. **Nordic Semiconductor nRF Series**:

   - Some simpler or fitness-focused smartwatches use Nordic's nRF series, like the nRF52832, which is known for its low power consumption and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support.

6. **Ambiq Micro Apollo Series**:
   - Known for ultra-low power consumption, these MCUs are used in some fitness trackers and smartwatches to extend battery life.

## Cost Considerations

### MCU Price Ranges

1. **Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear Series**: $20 to $50 or more per unit.
2. **Samsung Exynos Series**: $20 to $50 or more per unit.
3. **MediaTek MT2601**: $10 to $20 per unit.
4. **Nordic Semiconductor nRF Series**: $3 to $10 per unit.
5. **Ambiq Micro Apollo Series**: $2 to $10 per unit.

### Budget Constraints

Creating a Pokedex-like device with a budget of 400 INR (approximately $5 USD) is challenging. Consider the following:

- **ESP8266**: Around 150-200 INR.
- **ATmega328P (Arduino Nano/Uno)**: Around 100-150 INR.
- **STM32F0 Series**: Around 150-200 INR.
- **Bluetooth Module (HC-05/HC-06)**: Around 100-150 INR.
- **RFID Module (RC522)**: Around 100-150 INR.
- **Storage**: SD card module around 50-100 INR.

### DIY and Recycled Component Strategies

1. **Recycled Electronics**: Salvage parts from old devices or visit e-waste centers.
2. **DIY Components**: Use materials like cardboard or 3D-printed parts for enclosures.
3. **Low-Cost Alternatives**: Use basic LEDs and piezo buzzers.
4. **Simplified Design**: Focus on core functionality.
5. **Community Resources**: Join maker spaces or online forums.
6. **Educational Kits**: Use kits for learning and gathering parts.

By creatively sourcing and building components, you can significantly reduce costs and still achieve a functional prototype of your Pokedex device.
